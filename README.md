Mandatory 2: Make a machine learning project

Requirements. You must:
1. Briefly describe the problem you want to solve
2. Find a dataset (f.ex. from kaggle.com)
3. Prepare the data
4. Train a model or Self Organizing Map (SOM)
5. Evaluate the quality of the model / SOM.
 
Possible methods:
Supervised Learning:
- Deep Neural Network (previous example: bankcustomer, stay or leave)
- Convolutional Neural Network (previous example: recognize handwritten digits)
- Recurrent Neural Network (previous example: predict Google stock price)

Unsupervised Learning:
- Self Organizing Maps (previous example: detect fraud in Credit Card applications)
- Autoencoder (previous example: movie rating prediction)
